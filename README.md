# Wedding RSVP API.
This is a basic API to accepts a form post to track all those who are coming. Sends confirmation from my gmail account.

`/rsvp`


## Countdown
There's another part of the API that tracks the days countdown. 

`/countdown`

Built on Flask and MongoDB.

If you'd like to see my wedding site, even though I've taken down the working form and countdown - cause I'm hitched - you can visit wedding.happygrunt.com
